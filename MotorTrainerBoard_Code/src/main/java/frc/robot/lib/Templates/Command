/**
 * TemplateCommand
 * 
 * Description:
 * This is a general-purpose command template designed to interact with a given subsystem.
 * Extend and modify this class to create custom command logic for your robot.
 *
 * Features:
 * - Initializes, runs, and ends with built-in WPILib lifecycle methods.
 * - Clean structure to plug into the CommandScheduler.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Replace `TemplateSubsystem` with your actual subsystem class.
 * - Implement logic in `initialize()`, `execute()`, and `end()` as needed.
