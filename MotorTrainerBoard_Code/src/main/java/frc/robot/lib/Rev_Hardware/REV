This utility class tries to make coding motors easier how ever it adds complexity
If not used correctly or not double check before season it can be worse

To use this utility class go to the subsytem and write  public final Rev_(Type of Motor) = new Rev_(Type of Motor)(Allcondtion it needs)

Example public final REV_Vortex_Flex Leader = new REV_Vortex_Flex(All condition it need)

The condition you must put in can be place derectly of in the constant folder here is a break down of what you need just copy and paste
this into a new constants class

    /*Motor location */
    public static final String CANLoop = "rio";// Idenify which CAN loop motor is on
    public static final String MotorIdentification = "PlaceHolderName";//Change this to a helpful identification name

    public static final int[] MotorSpecifics ={
    1, //0 IdenMotor ID
   (Integer) null, //1 Static current limit leave as (Double) null to leave as default
   (Integer) null  //2 Emergency current limit leave as (Double) null to leave as default
    };

    /* Motion Tracking Constants*/
    public static final double[] PhysicalCharacteristics = {//Start counting at zero and every number after that is positive plus one
      0, //0  Gear Ratio
      0, //1  Wheel Radius [meters]
      10, //2 Time in seconds till disbled state changes 
      (Double)null//3 Tempurature OverHeat Warning will call
    }; 

    public static final boolean[] MotorStates = {//Start counting at zero and every number after that is positive plus one
      //Break mode is true 
      true, //0  Active Motor State
      false, //1 Invert Motor

    }; 


    public static final double[] TunnerValues = {
      0, //0  Position PID kP
      0, //1  Position PID kI
      0, //2  Position PID kD
      0, //3  Position FF  kV
      0, //4  Position iZone
      0, //5  Position iMaxAccumulation
      0, //6  Position OutPut Min
      0, //7  Position OutPut Max


      0, //8  Velocity PID kP
      0, //9  Velocity PID kI
      0, //10  Velocity PID kD
      0, //11  Velocity FF  kV
      0, //12  Velocity iZone
      0, //13  Velocity iMaxAccumulation
      0, //14  Velocity OutPut Min
      0, //15  Velocity OutPut Max

      0, //16  Velocity PID kP
      0, //17  Velocity PID kI
      0, //18  Velocity PID kD
      0, //19  Velocity FF  kV
      0, //20  Velocity iZone
      0, //21  Velocity iMaxAccumulation
      0, //22  Velocity OutPut Min
      0, //23  Velocity OutPut Max
 
    };

    public static final double[] MotionConstants = {
      0, //0 max Velocity
      0, //1 max Acceleration
      0, //2 allowed Closed Loop Error
    };


    After filling in values you will use these in the subsystem just call the classname.(what you are trying to call) the contructor will ask for the correct thing.
